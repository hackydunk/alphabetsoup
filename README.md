Berkeley Bootcamp - Module 19

### Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you’ll have to build your own machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. Your trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company—only those projects likely to be a success will receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup.

### Resources
- Jupyter Notebooks 6.0.1
- TensorFlow, Pandas

### Challenge Objectives

The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.
Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing.
Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.

### Challenge Summary

The code can be found in the AlphabetSoupChallenge.ipynb folder in the root of this repository.

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
- I chose 43

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
- The model reached the target performance level on the first attempt.

If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
- I would try a SVM model because SVMs are less prone to overfitting because they are trying to maximize the distance, rather than encompass all data within a boundary.
